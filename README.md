Dynamic Camera Caliber System

Camera calibration is an important task in computer vision applications. In a video surveillance system with a single static camera, object tracking results of moving objects can be effectively used for camera calibration. We propose a system that can be used for maintainig self tracking of any object. It is done using images of positive and negative images that are captured using a camera and compared to reference images of static objects. According to CNN, model will intelligently distinguish each sequence of images time to time in each convulutional layers. We have implemented this to show how its model works and its accuracy.
